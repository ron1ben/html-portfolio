<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time :</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Before Sunrise (1995)</h3>
<p>Unlike many mainstream films, the plot of this movie focuses on simple and yet profound interactions between the two protagonists, (Jesse and Céline), during their brief encounter in Vienna. This minimalist approach allows for a deeper exploration of human connection and intimacy.  Furthermore, Jesse and Céline discuss a wide range of topics, including love, life, and existentialism. These philosophical discussions elevate the film beyond a mere romance and invite viewers to ponder deeper questions about the nature of relationships and personal fulfillment.</p>
<h3>Metropolis (1927)</h3>
<p>Metropolis is an epic science fiction film set in a sprawling futuristic city where society is sharply divided between the wealthy ruling class and the oppressed working class. The film's grand scale and ambitious storytelling set it apart from other films of its time, and its themes of class struggle and social inequality remain relevant to this day.</p>
<h3>Into the Wild (2007)</h3>
<p>Into the Wild is unique for its compelling true story, exploration of profound themes, emotional depth, breathtaking visuals, and evocative soundtrack. It continues to resonate with audiences as a powerful and thought-provoking meditation on the human spirit and the pursuit of meaning and authenticity.</p>
